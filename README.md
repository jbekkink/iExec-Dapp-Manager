### Connecting with Metamask 
Before you can interact with the dapp, you will need to connect to the dapp with Metamask. If you haven't installed Metamask, make sure to install the extension. If installed, you will automatically get prompted by Metamask to login and connect to the iExec Sidechain. 

### Manage a Dapp
With iExec, it's possible to rent your Dapp to other users. On this page, you can create an order for a NFT by just setting a few parameters: 

#### Price 
The price a user would have to pay for renting your Dapp.

#### Volume 
The number of times your Dapp can be used for this order. 

#### Restrict to Dapp
You are able to restrict your Dapp for specific NFTs. You can then enter the address of this NFT in this field. Now, only this NFT is able to be used by your Dapp for a request, while the rest of the NFTs cannot be used.
